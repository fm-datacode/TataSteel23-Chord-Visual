Uses matrix information of player vs player wins at Tata Steel 2023 and creates a D3.JS chord diagram visual. This was built utilising ChatGPT advice, the article explaining the process can be found [here](https://medium.com/@fmarshall).

The original data (the matrix information in code) was sourced from the [Tata Steel 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel_Chess_Tournament_2023) results, the Python adjustment used is not shown here but easy to replicate.
